## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get File2MD up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed.
2.  **Ollama**: You must have the [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) application installed and running on your system.
3.  **Ollama Model**: Pull the required model by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```sh
    ollama pull granite4:tiny-h
    ```
    > **Note:** You can configure a different model by changing the `MODEL_NAME` variable in `config.py`.

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dovvnloading/File2MD.git
    cd File2MD
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
    ```sh
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    A `requirements.txt` is needed to install the necessary packages. Create the file with the content below, or find it in the repository.

    **`requirements.txt`:**
    ```
    PySide6
    ollama
    Markdown
    PySide6-WebEngine
    ```

    Install the packages using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**
    With Ollama running in the background and your virtual environment active, launch the app:
    ```sh
    python File2MD.py
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Load Content**: Click `Load File` to open a text or markdown file, or simply paste your text into the "Input" pane on the left.
2.  **Convert**: Click the `Convert to Markdown` button.
3.  **View Output**: The AI-formatted Markdown will stream into the "Markdown Output" pane on the right.
4.  **Toggle View**: Use the `View: Raw` / `View: Rendered` button to switch between the raw Markdown source and a styled HTML preview.
5.  **Save or Copy**: Once the conversion is complete, use the `Save` or `Copy` buttons to export your result.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules to maintain clean architecture and separation of concerns.

-   `File2MD.py`: The main entry point of the application. It initializes the Qt Application and the main window.
-   `main_window.py`: Contains the `MainWindow` class, which defines the UI layout, connects signals/slots, and manages the application's state.
-   `config.py`: A centralized module for all static configuration, including the AI model name, system prompt, and UI stylesheets.
-   `worker.py`: Defines the `ConversionWorker` class, which runs the Ollama AI conversion in a separate thread to keep the UI responsive.
-   `ui_components.py`: Houses custom UI widgets, such as the `CustomTitleBar`, to keep the main window code clean.
